<h3>About This Project</h3>

In a typical LoL database, match history is automatically updated on-click via API to avoid the same match being re-entered more than once.
However, for the purposes of this course, this HTML site allows users to input their match history manually.<br><br>

Going to Matches, Players or Player Matches will allow the user to perform CRUD operations.<br>
The Player Matches table may be filtered via the matchStatistics and playerStatistics columns from Matches and Players respectively.
Other tables only allow the insertion of new entries.<br>
